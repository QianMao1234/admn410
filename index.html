<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>At Durham House of Pets we know that being a pet owner is a huge responsilbity. Your animals rely on you to provide high-quality foods, and entertainment. But, with so many options available it can be confusing to determine which products are safe, and reputable. We take those stressors away! We only stock products that we personally have used, that are from reputable brands, and that we know your pets will love.</p>
<h1>Our History</h1>
<p>We began operations in 1975, when James Gordon had difficulities in the Durham area finding salt water aquaium supplies. When James opened the first store in Durham in 1975, he began by selling fish aquarium supplies. As the years passed, he began to offer not only fish aquairums, but also fish food and other products for fish owners. After several years of operations our customers continued to ask for dog and cat supplies. So, on the ten year anniversary of our store opening, we expanded to offering cat and dog foods and supplies.Today, our mission is to provide fish, cat, and dog owners with high-quality low-cost products that they can feel good about using.</p>
